# ESP32MatrixGames PS4 Controller Fork
This is my fork of s-marley's great software. My wish was to play these great old-school games on my DIY WS2812B 16x16 matrix, with PS4 controller, not via touch screen, so I adjusted code to my needs. All credits goes to s-marley and to few more people, I will mention them later when finalize this README.
